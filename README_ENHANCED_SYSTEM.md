## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ollama installed and running
- Gemma 3 12B model: `ollama pull gemma3:12b`
- Python 3.11+ with required packages

### Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements_enhanced.txt
   ```

2. **Start Enhanced System**:
   ```powershell
   Start_Enhanced_Juggernaut.bat
   ```

3. **Access Interface**:
   - Enhanced System: http://localhost:5001
   - Original System: http://localhost:5000 (if still running)

## Usage

### Basic System Commands

Ask your AI to perform system operations using natural language:

**File Analysis:**
- "Analyze my D: drive and show me the largest files"
- "Read the contents of D:/myfile.txt"
- "Search for all .py files in D:/Projects"

**System Information:**
- "Show me my system overview"
- "What software is installed on my computer?"
- "Check my system performance metrics"

**Command Execution:**
- "Run 'dir D:/' command"
- "Execute 'systeminfo' and show results"
- "Check disk usage with 'wmic logicaldisk get size,freespace,caption'"

### Advanced Operations

**Directory Analysis:**
```
"Analyze the directory structure of D:/JuggernautAI and show me:
- Total file count and sizes
- File type breakdown
- Largest files
- Directory structure"
```

**System Report:**
```
"Create a comprehensive system report including:
- Hardware specifications
- Drive analysis
- Installed software
- Performance metrics"
```

**File Content Analysis:**
```
"Read and analyze the file D:/myproject/config.json and explain:
- What the configuration does
- Any potential issues
- Recommendations for improvement"
```

## API Endpoints

The enhanced system provides these API endpoints for system access:

- `GET /api/system/overview` - Comprehensive system overview
- `POST /api/system/analyze-directory` - Analyze directory structure
- `POST /api/system/read-file` - Read and analyze file content
- `POST /api/system/execute-command` - Execute system commands
- `POST /api/system/search-files` - Search for files
- `GET /api/system/installed-software` - Get installed software list
- `GET /api/system/create-report` - Create comprehensive system report

## Security Considerations

### Allowed Operations
- ‚úÖ File reading and analysis
- ‚úÖ Directory structure analysis
- ‚úÖ System information gathering
- ‚úÖ Safe command execution
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring

### Restricted Operations
- ‚ùå File deletion or modification
- ‚ùå System file access (Windows/System32)
- ‚ùå Dangerous commands (format, del, shutdown)
- ‚ùå Access to restricted system areas
- ‚ùå Network configuration changes

### Path Restrictions
- **Allowed Drives**: C:, D:, E:, F:, G:, H:
- **Restricted Paths**: 
  - Windows/System32
  - Program Files/Windows NT
  - User AppData system files
  - System files (pagefile.sys, hiberfil.sys)

## Performance

### Expected Performance
- **Response Time**: 2-5 seconds for simple queries
- **System Analysis**: 5-15 seconds for drive analysis
- **File Reading**: Near-instant for files under 10MB
- **Command Execution**: Varies by command complexity

### Resource Usage
- **GPU Memory**: 8-10GB VRAM (RTX 4070 SUPER)
- **System Memory**: 4-6GB RAM
- **CPU Usage**: Low when using GPU acceleration
- **Disk I/O**: Minimal impact during analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AI system not ready"**
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify Gemma 3 model: `ollama pull gemma3:12b`

**"Path access not allowed"**
- Check if path is in allowed drives (C:, D:, E:, F:, G:, H:)
- Avoid restricted system directories

**"Command contains dangerous operation"**
- Avoid commands like: format, del, rm, shutdown
- Use safe alternatives for file operations

**"File too large"**
- File size limit is 100MB
- Use file analysis instead of full content reading

### Performance Issues

**Slow responses:**
- Check GPU memory usage
- Restart Ollama service if needed
- Reduce analysis depth for large directories

**High memory usage:**
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- Use CPU fallback if GPU memory is full

## Examples

### Example 1: Drive Analysis
```
User: "Analyze my D: drive and tell me what's taking up the most space"

AI: "I'll analyze your D: drive structure and identify the largest files and directories. Let me examine the drive contents..."

[AI performs drive analysis and provides detailed breakdown]
```

### Example 2: File Investigation
```
User: "Read the file D:/config.ini and explain what it does"

AI: "I'll read and analyze the configuration file for you..."

[AI reads file content and provides explanation]
```

### Example 3: System Overview
```
User: "Give me a complete overview of my system"

AI: "I'll generate a comprehensive system report including hardware, software, and performance metrics..."

[AI creates detailed system report]
```
